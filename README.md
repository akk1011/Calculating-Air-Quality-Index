### Understanding and Analyzing Air Quality Index (AQI) in India

#### Introduction

Air quality has a profound impact on our health and the environment. In recent years, the issue of air pollution in India has garnered significant attention due to its increasing severity and the consequent health risks. The Air Quality Index (AQI) is a tool used to communicate how polluted the air currently is or how polluted it is forecast to become. 

#### What is AQI?

The AQI is an index for reporting daily air quality. It tells you how clean or polluted your air is, and what associated health effects might be a concern. The AQI focuses on health effects you may experience within a few hours or days after breathing polluted air. AQI values range from 0 to 500, where a lower AQI value generally indicates better air quality and a higher AQI value indicates worse air quality.

#### AQI Categories

The AQI is divided into six categories:

1. **Good (0-50):** Minimal impact on health.
2. **Satisfactory (51-100):** May cause minor breathing discomfort to sensitive individuals.
3. **Moderate (101-200):** May cause breathing discomfort to people with lung disease, children and older adults.
4. **Poor (201-300):** May cause breathing discomfort to most people on prolonged exposure.
5. **Very Poor (301-400):** May cause respiratory illness on prolonged exposure.
6. **Severe (401-500):** May cause health impacts even on light physical activity, serious health risks for everyone.

#### AQI in India

Air pollution in India is a major environmental and health concern. Factors contributing to poor air quality include vehicle emissions, industrial activities, dust, and burning of biomass. Cities like Delhi, Mumbai, and Kolkata often experience high AQI levels, especially in winter months. The Indian government and various organizations are actively monitoring AQI and implementing measures to improve air quality.

#### Our Project

In this project, we analyze AQI data across different cities in India. We use historical AQI data to understand trends, identify pollution hotspots, and study the impact of various factors on air quality. Our analysis involves:

- Collecting and cleaning AQI data.
- Exploring data to understand temporal and spatial trends.
- Building predictive models to estimate AQI based on various environmental factors.
- Analyzing the effectiveness of pollution control measures.

#### Tools and Technologies

We utilize R for data analysis and machine learning, and tools like RStudio for interactive data exploration. The dataset includes parameters like PM2.5, PM10, NOx, CO, SO2, O3, among others.

#### Conclusion

Understanding and improving air quality is crucial for public health and environmental protection. Through our analysis, we aim to contribute to awareness and inform policy-making for better air quality management in India.
